The software aims at the control of emergency load shedding after UHVDC blocking.

The software mainly considers the system frequency constraints, and other constraints may be added in the future. The optimization objective is to minimize the total load shedding of the whole network.

The basic principle of the software is the deep learning driven differential evolution algorithm, and the deep learning model is updated based on the transfer learning theory.
